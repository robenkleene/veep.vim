INTRODUCTION                                        *veep*

Veep provides commands for running Ex commands and shell commands on
*characterwise* and *blockwise* visual selections.  Built-in Vim ranges always
operate on whole lines, so commands cannot operate on parts lines, Veep allows
running commands on parts lines.


                                                    *veep-:P*  *:P*

:P[!] {command}

Applies an Ex command to the visual selection. With a "!" display the result
in the echo area instead of replacing the selection.



                                                    *veep-:Psh*

:Psh {shell-command}

Shorthand for ":P !{shell-command}" and with "-complete=shellcmd" (":P"
uses -complete=command).

Veep also remaps Visual "!" to this command if the current selection is
characterwise or blockwise (linewise selection uses the built in "!").

                                                    *veep-:Pex*

:Pe[x][!] {command}

Like |:P| the range is ommitted when running the command this allows commands
like |:make| to be run that normally fail if a range is included when run.

                                                     *veep-:Pnew*

:Pn[ew][!] {command}

Like |:P|, but put the result in a new buffer instead of replacing the
selection.

With a "!" the range is ommitted when running the command this allows commands
like |:make| to be run that normally fail if a range is included when run.

If the command is omitted, a new buffer is created with the contents of the
selection unmodified.

                                                     *veep-:Pvnew*

:Pv[new][!] {command}

Like |:Pnew| but put the results in a vertical split.

                                                     *veep-:Penew*

:Pe[new][!] {command}

Like |:Pnew| but put the results in a new buffer.

                                                     *veep-:Ptabedit*

:Ptabn[ew][!] {command}
:Ptabe[dit][!] {command}

Like |:Pnew| but open the results in a new tab page.
